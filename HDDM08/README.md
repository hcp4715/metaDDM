# A docker image for DDM in Python

This is a repo of docker images for drift-diffusion modelling, including HDDM 0.9.0 (beta) and PyDDM. The previous docker images for HDDM 0.8.0, `hddm:arviz` can be found at at [hcp4715/hddm/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/hcp4715/hddm/tags).

## What is HDDM? 
HDDM is a python package for hierarchical drift diffusion modelling, see [here](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/index.html) for more.
PyDDM is a generalized drift diffusion model simulator, see [here](https://pyddm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for more. 

## What's new about this docker image?
This docker image was based on a previous HDDM docker image by Mads ([@madslupe](https://hub.docker.com/r/madslupe/hddm)), with a few improvements. 
* Parallel processing with `p_tqdm` (pathos and tqdm). 
* With the latest HDDM package.
* A few new python packages that are used for plotting (`seaborn`, `plotly`).
* Related packages for Bayesian inference (`Arviz`, `pymc3`, and `bambi`).
* Include `pyddm`  as an altenative.

In the `examples` folder of this docker image (see below on how to use this image), you can find two example jupyter notebooks: one for reproducing the [official tutorial](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/tutorial.html), and one for converting HDDM model objects into `ArviZ` InferenceData.

## How to use this docker image
### Installation
First, install `docker` and test it. There are many tutorials on this.

#### Ubuntu
Please read this [post on docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for installing docker for linux (ubuntu included).

Then, pull the current docker image from docker hub:

```
docker pull hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta
```

**Note**: you may need sudo permission to run the command `docker`.

#### Window 10 (pro)
Please read this [post](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for installing docker on window 10. During the installation of docker, you might be instructed to install/update your window subsystem linux (WSL), please follow the instruction to finish the installation of docker.

Then, open window power shell, and pull the current docker image from docker hub:

```
docker pull hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta
```

### Open Jupyter notebook

After pulling it from docker hub, you can then run jupyter notebook in the container (e.g., in bash of linux or power shell of windows):

#### Example code for Ubuntu:
```
docker run -it --rm --cpus=4 \
-e NB_USER=jovyan -e CHOWN_HOME=yes -e CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS='-R' -w /home/jovyan/ \
-v /home/hcp4715/hddm_docker:/home/jovyan/hddm \
-p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta jupyter notebook
```

#### Example code for windows:

```
docker run -it --rm --cpus=4 -e NB_USER=jovyan -e CHOWN_HOME=yes -e CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS='-R' -w /home/jovyan/ -v /d/hcp4715/hddm_docker:/home/jovyan/hddm -p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta jupyter notebook  
```

#### Explanations of the example code

`docker run` ---- Run a docker image in a container

`-it` ---- Keep STDIN open even if not attached

`--rm` ---- Automatically remove the container when it exits

`--cpus=5` ---- [Optional] Number of cores will be used by docker

`-e NB_USER=jovyan -e CHOWN_HOME=yes -e CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS='-R' -w /home/jovyan/`  ---- [Optional] Give the current user permission to write files. 

`-v` ---- Mount a folder to the container

`/home/hcp4715/ddm_docker` ---- The directory of a local folder where I stored my data. [For Linux]

`/d/hcp4715/ddm_docker` ---- The directory of a local folder under drive D. It appears as `D:\hcp4715\ddm_docker` in windows system.

`/home/jovyan/ddm` ---- The directory inside the docker image (the mounting point of the local folder in the docker image). Note that the docker container itself likes a mini virtual linux system, so the file system inside it is linux style. 

`-p 8888:8888` ---- Publish a containerâ€™s port(s) to the host. The default port is `8888`. When running two containers at the same time, you can change another container's port as `-p 8787:8888`. 

`hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta` ---- The docker image to run, `0.9_beta` after `:` is the tag of the current docker image.

`jupyter notebook` ---- Open juypter notebook when start running the container.

After running the code above, bash will has output like this:

```
....
....
To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://174196acc395:8888/?token=75f1a7a8ffcbb55f0c2802433a9a5d57ac00868e05089c09
 or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=75f1a7a8ffcbb55f0c2802433a9a5d57ac00868e05089c09
```

Copy the full url (http://127.0.0.1:8888/?.......) to a browser (firefox or chrome) and press return, it will show a web page, this is the interface of jupyter notebook! Note, in Windows system, it might be `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` in the url. If you used `-p 8787:8888`, then you need to change the `8888` in the url to `8787` before pressing the return key. 

Under the `Files` tab, there should be two folders: `examples` and `ddm`. The `ddm` folder is the local folder mounted in docker container. The `examples` folder was the one built in docker image, this folder includes one dataset and one jupyter notebook, you can test the parallel processing by running this jupyter notebook.

Enter `ddm` folder, you can start your analysis within jupyter notebook.

## Using example
The `examples` folder also includes two jupyter notebooks, `hddm_demo_docker.ipynb` reproduces the demo script, using the `HDDM` in this docker image; `Test_HDDMnn.ipynb` is the script to test whether the function `HDDMnn` work.

```
docker run -it --rm --cpus=5 \
-p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta jupyter notebook
```

## Potential errors
* Permission denied. If you still encounter this error, please see this [post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hddm-users/Qh-aOC0N6cU) about the permission problem. 

## How this docker image was built
An alternative way to get the docker image is to build it from `Dockerfile`.

I built this docker image under Ubuntu 20.04. 

This Dockerfile is modified by Dr. Rui Yuan @ Stanford, based on the Dockerfile of [jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook/dockerfile). We installed additional packages for Bayesian inference and DDM. See `Dockerfile` for the details

The command for building the docker image (don't forget the `.` in the end):

```
docker build -t hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta -f Dockerfile .
```
