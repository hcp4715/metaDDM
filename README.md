# metaDDM: A docker image for drift diffusion modelling
Drift-diffusion models (DDMs) or Evidence accumulation models (EAMs) are widely used in studying human decision-making. However, different packages provided different and limited functions for DDM. The goal of metaDDM is to provide an all-in-one solution for DDM related python packages. The future plan is to also include other packages, such `r` packages in this docker image. 

## What is DDM? 
To be continued ...

## Python packages for DDM
### [HDDM](https://hddm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
HDDM is a python toolbox for hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation of the Drift Diffusion Model (via PyMC2.3.8).

### [pyDDM](https://github.com/mwshinn/PyDDM)
PyDDM is a simulator and modeling framework for generalized drift-diffusion models (DDM), with a focus on cognitive neuroscience.

### [PyBEAM](https://github.com/murrowma/pybeam)
PyBEAM (Bayesian Evidence Accumulation Models) is a Python package designed to rapidly fit two-boundary, binary choice models to choice-RT data using Bayesian inference methods. 

## Supporting packages
A complete workflow for DDM needs packages other than parameter estimation or simulation, but more, e.g., statstical inference, visualization. In this docker image, we included python packages we think are essential for complete workflow:

### Packages for parallel processing
`p_tqdm`, which includs `pathos` and `tqdm`.

### Bayesian inference
`ArviZ`, `pymc3`, and `bambi`

### Visualization
`seaborn` and `plotly`

### To be continued...

## Tags of current docker image
This image include different tag, each represent a different versions. 

## How to use this docker image
In the `example` folder of this docker image (see below on how to use this image), you can find two example jupyter notebooks: one for reproducing the [official tutorial](http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/tutorial.html), and one for converting HDDM model objects into `ArviZ` InferenceData.

### Installation
First, install `docker` and test it. There are many tutorials on this.

#### Ubuntu
Please read this [post on docker's website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for installing docker for linux (ubuntu included).

Then, pull the current docker image from docker hub:

```
docker pull hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta
```

**Note**: you may need sudo permission to run the command `docker`.

#### Window 10 (pro)
Please read this [post](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for installing docker on window 10. During the installation of docker, you might be instructed to install/update your window subsystem linux (WSL), please follow the instruction to finish the installation of docker.

Then, open window power shell, and pull the current docker image from docker hub:

```
docker pull hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta
```

### Open Jupyter notebook

After pulling it from docker hub, you can then run jupyter notebook in the container (e.g., in bash of linux or power shell of windows):

#### Example code for Ubuntu:
```
docker run -it --rm --cpus=4 \
-e NB_USER=jovyan -e CHOWN_HOME=yes -e CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS='-R' -w /home/jovyan/ \
-v /home/hcp4715/hddm_docker:/home/jovyan/hddm \
-p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.9.5 jupyter notebook
```

#### Example code for windows:

```
docker run -it --rm --cpus=4 -e NB_USER=jovyan -e CHOWN_HOME=yes -e CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS='-R' -w /home/jovyan/ -v /d/hcp4715/hddm_docker:/home/jovyan/hddm -p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta jupyter notebook  
```

#### Explanations of the example code

`docker run` ---- Run a docker image in a container

`-it` ---- Keep STDIN open even if not attached

`--rm` ---- Automatically remove the container when it exits

`--cpus=5` ---- Number of cores will be used by docker

`-e NB_USER=jovyan -e CHOWN_HOME=yes -e CHOWN_EXTRA_OPTS='-R' -w /home/jovyan/`  ---- Give the current user permission to write files.

`-v` ---- Mount a folder to the container

`/home/hcp4715/hddm_docker` ---- The directory of a local folder where I stored my data. [For Linux]

`/d/hcp4715/hddm_docker` ---- The directory of a local folder under drive D. It appears as `D:\hcp4715\hddm_docker` in windows system.

`/home/jovyan/hddm` ---- The directory inside the docker image (the mounting point of the local folder in the docker image). Note that the docker container itself likes a mini virtual linux system, so the file system inside it is linux style. 

`-p` ---- Publish a containerâ€™s port(s) to the host

`hcp4715/hddm:0.9_beta` ---- The docker image to run, `0.9_beta` after `:` is the tag of the current docker image.

`jupyter notebook` ---- Open juypter notebook when start running the container.

After running the code above, bash will has output like this:

```

To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6-open.html
Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
    http://174196acc395:8888/?token=75f1a7a8ffcbb55f0c2802433a9a5d57ac00868e05089c09
 or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=75f1a7a8ffcbb55f0c2802433a9a5d57ac00868e05089c09
```

Copy the full url (http://127.0.0.1:8888/?.......) to a browser (firefox or chrome) and it will show a web page, this is the interface of jupyter notebook! Note, in Windows system, it might be `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1` in the url.

Under the `Files` tab, there should be three folders: `work`, `example`, and `hddm`. The `hddm` folder is the local folder mounted in docker container. The `example` folder was the one built in docker image, this folder includes one dataset and one jupyter notebook, you can test the parallel processing by running this jupyter notebook.

Enter `hddm` folder, you can start your analysis within jupyter notebook.

## Using example
The `example` folder also includes two other jupyter notebooks, `HDDM_official_tutorial_reproduced.ipynb` reproduces the tutorial code, using the `HDDM` in this docker image; `HDDM_official_tutorial_ArviZ.ipynb` illustrates how to convert HDDM data to `ArviZ` InferenceData to plot posterior traces and posterior predictives (but not work with `loo` and `waic` yet).

```
docker run -it --rm --cpus=5 \
-p 8888:8888 hcp4715/hddm:0.9.5 jupyter notebook
```

## Potential errors
* Permission denied. If you still encounter this error, please see this [post](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/hddm-users/Qh-aOC0N6cU) about the permission problem. 

## How this docker image was built
An alternative way to get the docker image is to build it from `Dockerfile`.

I built this docker image under Ubuntu 20.04. 

This Dockerfile is modified by Dr. Rui Yuan @ Stanford, based on the Dockerfile of [jupyter/scipy-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook/dockerfile). We installed additional packages for Bayesian inference and DDM. See `Dockerfile` for the details

The command for building the docker image (don't forget the `.` in the end):

```
docker build -t hcp4715/hddm:0.9.5 -f Dockerfile .
```
